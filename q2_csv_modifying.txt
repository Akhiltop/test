How will you tackle the challenge above?
initially i will decide whether to make it in a normal java project or maven or springboot.
Later on will take help of opencsv library by way of importing it to read and write the csv.
The major takle will be with reading of formula , normal values can be read easily.
if i carefully observe i have a indication that formula starts with "="
this acts as an indication for me that its a formula.
Next if i see either it starts with the alphabet or a value.
if it starts with the alphabet i would be looping until the end of the value , later takes the operation and goes to the next value or cell reference.
cell reference values can be obtained by usage of maps or a new object so that i can get the value of the cell referenced and perform the operation.
By this way i can get the required output and then writes the csv using writer methods of opencsv




What type of errors you would you check for?
As far i think the errors i may confront is 
1.reference being not found or reference is blank.
2.division errors if value is 0.
3.circular reference i.e both cells depend on each other.
4.the referenced cell should be of some value or else arithmetic operations cant be performed.
5.dealing with type of value in java such as int,long,float,double etc.


How might a user break your code?
inorder to break my code, i think initially the user has to know my code base.
If any loose queries are written in the backend it can cause security issues(such as searching data with
blank may result in getting all the data in backend)
improper security or authentication makes the user to go with various parts of the project etc.
